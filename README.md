# What is this useful for ?

Bibliotech is a utility library designed to grow over time following my needs.

# Browser support

This library targets modern browsers, as in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and other browsers that use those engines, such as Edge. If you have to target much older versions of those browsers, use a transpiler.

# Changes

See the [CHANGELOG](CHANGELOG.md) to be the first to use the new features and to stay up to date with breaking changes.

# Installation

```sh
npm install bibliotech
```
